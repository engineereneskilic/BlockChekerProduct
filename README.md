## Key Features & Technologies
### Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: 
  - All product data, including block names and hash values, is securely recorded on the blockchain.
  - Ensures data immutability and prevents tampering.
- **Encrypted QR Codes**: 
  - Unique QR codes are generated for each product, making it extremely difficult for counterfeiters to replicate.
  - The QR codes contain encrypted product details for secure verification.
- **Real-Time Verification**: 
  - A cloud database ensures real-time validation of product authenticity.
- **Interactive Frontend**: 
  - Built with **React.js**, the web application offers a seamless and user-friendly experience.
- **Camera Integration**:
  - The web app uses the device's camera for real-time QR code scanning and decoding.

### Technologies
- **Blockchain**: Secure data storage and verification.
- **React.js**: Frontend development for interactive user interfaces.
- **Cloud Database**: Real-time data validation (e.g., Firebase or MongoDB).
- **QR Code Libraries**: For generating and decoding encrypted QR codes.

## Why This Project?
Counterfeit products cost industries billions of dollars annually and pose risks to consumer safety. Traditional product verification systems are often ineffective due to:
- Lack of transparency.
- Difficulty in verifying product origins.
- High vulnerability to tampering.

**BlockCheckerProduct** addresses these issues by:
1. **Providing Trust**: Blockchain ensures data cannot be altered.
2. **Simplifying Verification**: QR codes make product validation quick and accessible.
3. **Empowering Customers**: Transparent systems instill confidence in buyers.

---

## Process Workflow

### 1. Manufacturer Stage
- **QR Code Generation**: 
  - Manufacturers generate encrypted QR codes for each product using the web app.
- **Blockchain Recording**: 
  - Product details and QR code data are securely stored on the blockchain. Each record includes:
    - **Block Name**: A unique identifier for the product.
    - **Hash Value**: Ensures data integrity.
    - **Timestamp**: Records the creation time for traceability.

### 2. Seller Verification
- **QR Code Scanning**:
  - Sellers scan QR codes on incoming products using the web application.
- **Data Matching**:
  - The app decrypts QR code data and matches it with blockchain records.
  - Results:
    - **Match Found**: Product is verified as authentic.
    - **No Match**: Product is flagged as counterfeit.

### 3. Customer Transparency
- **Product Verification**:
  - Customers scan QR codes on purchased products to verify their authenticity.
- **User Confidence**:
  - The system ensures customers can trust the origin and integrity of the product.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Blockchain**: Custom blockchain for secure data storage.
- **QR Code Libraries**: Libraries such as `qrcode.react` for generating QR codes.
- **Database**: Cloud storage for real-time data validation (e.g., Firebase or MongoDB).
